  * Calculated the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Code in the main Github repository is organised as follows:
Final code has been saved to the Github repository python-challenge.
Python-challenge folder contains a folder for PyBank and PyPoll.
Folders PyBank and PyPoll each contain the main code to mainpybank.py and mainpypoll.py and a Resources folder. 
The analysis folder is located in each folder of PyBank and PyPoll which contains the printed output.
VS Code was utilzed to write the python script.
I have created a git ignore on my resources folder due to the size of the data used.
