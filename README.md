Python: Py Me Up, Charlie

PyBank: Created a Python script that analyzes the Financial records of a company to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
 
 ByPoll: Created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Code in the main Github repository is organised as follows:
Python-challenge folder contains a folder for both PyBank and PyPoll.
Both PyBank and PyPoll contain a main.py for the code. I have renamed the code in each main.py to mainpybank.py and mainpypoll.py. 
I've used VS Code to write my programs.
An analysis folder is located in each folder of PyBank and PyPoll. This analysis folder contains the output of my program.
I have created a git ignore on my resources folder due to the size of the data used.
